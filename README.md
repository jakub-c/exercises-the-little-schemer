# Notes and exercises from The Little Schemer

This is a documentation of the code I wrote when working my way through this great book. The result is a combination of files written in Racket and Scheme. Both languages / dialects are available by default in DrRacket IDE which I do recommend as a companion for the book.

## General remarks

If you read [How to Design Programs (see documentation of my progress)](https://github.com/jakub-c/exercises-how-to-design-programs) than the gist of the book will be familiar. The Scheme language might take a moment to get used to, but it’s just couple of different keywords if you know Racket already. For example `null?` for `empty?`, `car` for `first` and `cdr` for `rest`. If you never tried Lisp based languages the syntax will look foreign but don’t get thrown off, keep going.

An emphasis on recursion as the tool for problem solving and computation is the same between HtDP and Little Schemer.

I actually tried this book out few years ago and I was quickly discouraged by seemingly cryptic questions about atoms and weird syntax. It took a while but I think now I have a better understanding how profound the content of the book is.

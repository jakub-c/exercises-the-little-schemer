All information in this chapter has been explained thoroughly in the [How to Design Programs](https://htdp.org/) book.

Most foundational concept:

> Recur - refer to the function with new arguments.

Key ingredients to make `recursion` work illustrated by **The First Commandment**

> Always ask `null?` (`empty` in Racket) as the first question in expressing any function

In order to create a recursive function that goes over a list we need:

- a termination condition (see the First Commandment) because we need to stop at some point otherwise we’ll run out of the memory and / or make infinite amount of calls
- recur with a reduced number of items - we can use `cdr` (`rest` in Racket) for that

A typical simple recursive function (presented in this chapter) does the following:

- check if the base condition is met (list is empty)
  - if it is - terminate
- if it’s not - more forward
- check if the first element from the list meets a given condition
  - if yes - return a result
  - if not - recur with using `cdr` (check the rest of items from the list)

Can you describe what the function `lat?` does in your own words?

`lat?` goes through each and every item on a given list. If all items in the list are atoms it will eventually go through all elements and end up as an empty list (because we’re `cdr`ing - taking the `rest` from the list in each pass). When we get to an empty list we return `#t` because all items passed the test. If we get to a non atomic entity on the way - we just throw an error right away.

Can you describe how we determined the value `#f` for `(lat? ‘(bacon (and eggs))`

We go through all elements of the list, first we check if `bacon` is an atom. It is. Because of that we make a new check for the rest of the items using `cdr`. Next item in the list is another list. Is list an atom? No. Therefore we need to follow the `else` statement which returns `#f`.

# Chapter 01

The purpose of this chapter is to introduce foundational data structures we use to compute things.

If you had any previous experience with Lisp like languages you might already know that it all starts with an `S-expression`.

`S-expression` is one of:

- an `atom`
- `list` of `atom`

Examples of an `atom`:

- `“a”`
- `2`
- `#f`

Example of a `list`:

- `(1 “a” #t)`

You cannot split the `atom` but you can combine multiple `atom`s into lists. They can be nested as much as you’d like. For example:

- `(one (one two) (one (one two three)))`

`atom` is one of:

- a character
- a number
- a boolean statement (`#t`, `#f`)

 Two essential functions we can use on the lists:

- `car` - take the first item (`first` in Racket)
- `cdr` - take all the items but first (`rest` in Racket)

We can also compare non-numeric atoms with `eq?`

This minimal set of rules and data definitions provides us with quite a powerful toolset. Its power is not apparent yet, we need one more ingredient `recursion`. See chapter 02 for more information.

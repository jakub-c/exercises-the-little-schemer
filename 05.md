Can you describe what `leftmost` does?

`leftmost` always takes the first item from the S-expression until it reaches the atom. It returns that atom.

`or` returns true when it encounters the first evaluation that returns true and then it stops.

`and` returns false when it encounters the first evaluation that returns false and then it stops.

What is a difference between a list and an S-expression?

An S-expression is a list with one exception, it can also be just a single atom.

Valid S-expressions:

- `’(a (a b))`
- `’a`

Valid lists:

- `’(a (a b))`
- `’(a)`
